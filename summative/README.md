# Youth Employment Income Predictor - Summative Assignment


A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts youth employment income using various socio-economic factors. The project includes a Jupyter notebook for data analysis, a FastAPI backend, and a Flutter mobile application.

## üìä Dataset Description & Source

**Dataset Source:** [Kaggle - Youth Employment Status Rwanda](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/talentsphere/youth-employment-status-rw)

**Description:**

This dataset contains detailed records of youth in Rwanda, including demographic, educational, regional, and economic factors. It features over 10,000 samples and 25 variables, providing rich volume and variety for robust machine learning analysis. The data is used to predict monthly income based on factors such as age, gender, education, region, employment rates, digital skills, training participation, household size, and income level.

## üìà Key Data Visualizations

Below are some of the most important visualizations that influenced model development:
